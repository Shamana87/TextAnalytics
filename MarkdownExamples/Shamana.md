# WHAT IS AN ACAI BOWL?
An **acai bowl** is a blended mixture of __acai berries__ and other fruits, served in a _bowl_ and topped with a *variety* of fresh fruit, nuts and seeds.

> Acai berries is a small fruit native to Central and South America and are considered a superfood because of their high antioxidant levels. They’re definitely becoming a trendy ingredient, there are acai smoothie bowl shops popping up everywhere in my town! You can find packets of acai berry puree in the freezer section of most grocery stores, either with the frozen fruit or the cans of frozen juice. Just break up your acai packet into pieces, toss it into the blender with the other ingredients and you’re ready to go!

## HOW DO YOU MAKE AN ACAI BOWL?
These acai bowls are actually very quick and easy to make, and your family will never guess that they’re full of good-for-you foods! The recipe starts with a smoothie base. I used frozen banana, apple juice, vanilla yogurt, frozen berries and acai berry puree.

ACAI BOWL TIPS
I find that the texture of the acai bowls are best if served immediately. If you’re looking to make them in advance for meal prep purposes, you can blend up the fruit mixture and store it in small containers in the freezer. Let the acai mixture partially thaw, give it a stir and you’ll be ready to eat.
If you’re looking to make this recipe vegan, you can use non dairy yogurt and agave or maple syrup instead of the honey.
Not a berry fan? You can blend you acai with peaches, pineapple or mango if you prefer a different flavor.
